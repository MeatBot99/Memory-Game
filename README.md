# Feat: A card matching game based short term memory

This is my take on the **_Udacity_** memory game. It is the second
project for the *Front End Nanodegree* program. This is the 
first and hopefully final commit. Feel free to check it out.

I was going for functionality over styling. I have to make it
work before I should even try to make it look good. It looks
pretty good though.

The project is a javascript intensive learning tool. It took
what I thought I knew about javascript and made me apply it 
to a real thing. A humbling journey but I am happy with the
results.

Dependencies:
 -Font Awesome
