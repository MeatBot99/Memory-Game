# Feat: A card matching game based short term memory

This is my take on the **_Udacity_** memory game. It is the second
project for the *Front End Nanodegree* program.

The project is a javascript intensive learning tool. It took
what I thought I knew about javascript and made me apply it 
to a real thing. A humbling journey but I am happy with the
results.

# Directions:

Click on a card and it will reveal itself.
Click on another card and see if they match. 
When all cards are matches, you win!

The fewer turns you take, the higher your rating will be.
Try to earn 3 stars for maximum scoring potential!

Dependencies:

 -Font Awesome
 
 -Animate.css
